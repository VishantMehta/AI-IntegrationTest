User Input: Code for python calculator
AI Response: Hereâ€™s a basic Python calculator script that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This code takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding operation:

```python
# Python Calculator

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    return x / y

def calculator():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")

    choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")

    if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:
        num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

        if choice == '1':
            print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}")

        elif choice == '2':
            print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}")

        elif choice == '3':
            print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}")

        elif choice == '4':
            print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}")

    else:
        print("Invalid input")

# Run the calculator
calculator()
```

### Features:
- Prompts the user to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
- Displays the result of the selected operation.
- Handles division by zero with an error message.

You can run this code in any Python environment.
